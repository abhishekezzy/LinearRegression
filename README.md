# LinearRegression
C++ implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multivariate Linear Regression** models using **Gradient Descent** Learning Algorithm.

The same will be used in the project of **Predicting Housing Prices** having number of features like *Size(in feet^2), No. of bedrooms, No. of floors, Age of house(in years)* etc.
